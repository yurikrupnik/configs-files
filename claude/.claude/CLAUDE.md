- Always use the latest SDK updates with context7 and use the internet to make sure as review.   
- Always use bun instead of npm or pnpm
- Always prefer a Rust application to be created over another language, choose other languages only when it is more suitable for the task.
- Always prefer nu scripts over shell scripts.

- Don't add comments. At all. Unless something is VERY convoluted or looks confusing. THIS IS CRUCIAL.
- Whenever you encounter new things about the system or my general preferences that would be useful for you to remember, make a suggestion to add notes to your config files.
- After creating PRs, offer to open them with the 'open' command.
  When creating prs that has a corresponding issue, remember to add "close #123" so it closes as well.
